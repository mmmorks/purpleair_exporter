# `purpleair_exporter`

This is a Prometheus/OpenMetrics exporter for [PurpleAir air quality sensors](https://www.purpleair.com).

This tool runs an HTTP server which responds to requests for `/purpleair?target=â€¦` by making HTTP request(s) to the
target PurpleAir sensor over your local network. There are no API keys needed, and it works fully offline. This
strategy is similar to the [SNMP exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter), essentially acting as a
Prometheus-to-PurpleAir proxy. One instance of this exporter can easily support multiple sensors even on a
resource-constrained host.

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'purpleair'
    metrics_path: /purpleair
    scrape_interval: 1s    # if you dare
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
      - source_labels: [__param_target]
        target_label: instance
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: 127.0.0.1:2020  # this exporter's hostname:port
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - 172.16.4.40   # address of a sensor
          - 172.16.4.41
          - 172.16.4.42
```

## Configuration

Minimal, via environment variables:

* `LISTEN`: a host and port on which the web server should bind
* `PORT`: a port on which the web server should bind

If neither of these are set, the exporter runs on `:2020`. There is no authentication for this service, no sensor
configuration, and no TLS, just like the PurpleAir sensors themselves.

## Metrics endpoint

`GET /purpleair` supports the following URL parameters:

* `target`: the IP address of the sensor (required)
* `period`: `1s` if you only want 1-second readings, `2m` if you only want 2-minute averages, empty if you want both

## Status

This works for me and my [PurpleAir Flex](https://www2.purpleair.com/products/purpleair-flex) setup. Feel free to open
pull requests with proposed changes.
